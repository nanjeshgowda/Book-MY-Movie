# Book-MY-Movie
I designed and developed a movie booking interface using C++.

This was an improvisation to our previous project "Airline Interface", because we made use of file handling so that we could manipulate the data with operations such as read and write. The program would take inputs from the user and works like an actual Movie ticket reservation system, but this was implemented on a turbo compiler using certain graphic functions as well. The user was able to print the ticket at the end.
